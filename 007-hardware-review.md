# 100 Days of Homelab: Day #4 - A lot of stuff
Today was hardware day !

## Hardware reviewing
Today I reviewed all of the hardware I received over the past week. I tested disks to make sure they were working (amazon delivery, you never know...), tested 1U shelves for the optiplex micros, tested patch cables and keystone clips.Tested noctua fans as well and some 500GB NVMe SSD that I ordered. For now everything seems to be working, so it should be pretty painless to upgrade ! 

See you tomorrow !

# 100 Days of Homelab: Day #9 - BunkerWeb
BunkerWeb looks awsome !

## BunkerWeb
So, today I got to play a little with that thing called [bunkerweb](https://www.bunkerity.com/bunkerweb/), and it's awesome ! I haven't configured much, mainly went through the documentation and setup process, but the options listed are very promising and I can't wait to get it to work properly. This might be able to replace cloudflare proxying (except it will not hide my public IP) which is the direction I want to go because of the 100Mb size limit on the http request.

See you tomorrow !

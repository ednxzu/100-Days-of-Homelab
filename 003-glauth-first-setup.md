# 100 Days of Homelab: Day #3 - GLAuth first steps
Another not so productive day... but I'm still making progress !

## GLAuth tryouts
I've battled a bit with GLAuth today after realizing FreeIPA was WAY too much for my needs, and it didn't really go as planned. It made me realize I'm lacking a lot of knowledge in the LDAP department, So instead of going at it like a maniac, I'll take a few steps back and learn how it actually works in the details.
I fell like it's gonna take a while but it's such an essential skill that I cannot overlook it at all.

So yeah, that's basically it, not so much done today... but I found this [WebUI](https://github.com/sonicnkt/glauth-ui) project for GLAuth, which seems to work, so this could be what I end up doing ! GLAuth + authelia would really have a small foorprint and I'm all for it !

See you tomorrow !
